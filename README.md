# KDE Devcontainer

This repository is an example for creating a KDE/Qt devcontainer.

The example KDE application is taken and modified from the KDevelop "Kirigami (Qt6)" template.

If you are using a Wayland system that supports devcontainers, the devcontainer will make it a *breeze* to develop a new application!

You can run `python initialize_repository.py` to quickly set up your project.
